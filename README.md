Penguin Rush Unity Edition

This was a game which was made on a 24 Hackathon named KairosHacks on Barcelona.
The original game we made had an additonal additional hardware as paddles to be played with your feet,
and can be found here " https://github.com/Pinkii-/KHack  ".

In this version, which has beeen build using unity the support to android devices and touch screen is added,
and the game evolved to new experiences you will surely enjoy.

With the build you can play both with windows or android devices, but remember the game is still on developement.

Enjoy it very much, and be aware of new content added!
